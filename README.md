## ‚ú® Capabilities

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Script samples gallery

Using `PnP PS: Open samples gallery` command, or the 'Samples' button from the controls above the command list, you may open the gallery with all available script samples. Currently, the samples shown are retrieved from the [PnP script samples repository](https://github.com/pnp/script-samples). From the samples gallery you may go to the sample location or create a new tab (file) in the editor prefilled with the PnP PowerShell script. It is possible to search for samples by:

- title
- authors
- commands used in samples

This functionality provides PnP PowerShell docs view for all commands inside VS Code. No more context switching between the code editor and browser. It is possible to go to docs original website location and also open the sample gallery showing all samples using that command.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Snippets

The extensions help to quickly find the correct PnP PowerShell command and use it thanks to code snippets. The command is added along with all required parameters. It is possible to quickly move between parameters using 'Tab' key. Each snippet has a description which may be found in the docs which is a great help to quickly understand the commands functionality.

![snippetsList](./assets/images/snippets.gif)

In order to use snippets please type part of a PnP PowerShell command and press enter or tab. The command will be automatically added to the code along with all required parameters. You may also use 'Ctrl + Space' (Windows, Linux) or 'Cmd + Space' (macOS) to activate snippets from within the editor.
